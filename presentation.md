**Using deep learning to model the hierarchical structure and function of a cell.**

# Introduction

* Neural networks are powerful classifiers but their internal structures are hard to interpret.

* densely entangled network structures that are neither tied to an actual physical system nor based on human reasoning.

* Powerful but not useful where simulation is needed of system function _and_ system structure.

    * Applications in biology and medicine seek to model both functional outcome _and_ mechanism.

* "Visible neural networks" (VNN) enable relation of a neural network structure to biological function.

# DCell

* 2,526 biological "systems"
    *
